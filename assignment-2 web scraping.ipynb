In addition to the SVJ-sourced 6.5-liter V12, the Sian uses a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Total system output is 819 horsepower (611 kilowatts), which also makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever. As confirmed by the 63 stuck on either side of the Sian’s wing, Lamborghini will produce just 63 units. And each will cost far more than the Aventador SVJ, carrying a price of $3.6 million.',\n",
